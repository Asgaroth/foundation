<h3>Support</h3>
                <h4 class="subheader">Foundation was designed for and tested on numerous browsers and devices. Here's the rundown on what's tested, and what to do if something misbehaves.</h4>

                <h4>Browser and Device Support</h4>
                <p>We go to great lengths to ensure that Foundation works as expected on a variety of common browsers and devices. Given how forward-facing Foundation is there are some aesthetic properties which are not supported in older browsers (border radii, box shadows, etc), but the core elements are reliable across the board.</p>

                <h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
                <h5>Why doesn't Foundation 3 support IE6 or IE7?</h5>
                <p>Both IE6 and IE7 have serious issues which make support for them detrimental to the overall experience. Rather than having a single codebase that supports all the way back to those browsers, but is less useful and flexible for everyone, we opted to not support these browsers. Not only do they have extremely small, rapidly dwindling user bases, but not supporting them allows us the use of things like <code>box-sizing: border-box</code> and other tools.</p>
                <p>If IE7 support is important for your users / customers, you can use <a href="../files/foundation-download-2.2.1.zip">Foundation 2.2.1</a>, which supports IE7.</p>

                <h5>Why can't I see the responsive stuff in IE8?</h5>
                <p>The responsive nature of Foundation takes effect through media queries, which IE8 does not support. However, the intent of media queries is to make changes for devices, rather than uncommonly small IE8 windows, so this is not an issue that comes up in practice.</p>

                <h5>Can I use Foundation for something I'm going to sell?</h5>
                <p>Yes! Foundation is licensed under the MIT open source license, meaning you can do almost anything with it. The only thing you can't do is imply that Foundation itself is what you're selling.</p>

                <h5>Is Foundation tested on [some other device or browser]?</h5>
                <p>We try and be comprehensive in our testing, but there are thousands of devices so it's often just not feasible. We'd love to hear about Foundation's behaviour on other devices, but the list above is what we test each release on. If your browser or device is not listed your results may vary.</p>
