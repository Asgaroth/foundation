                <h4>What's in Foundation?</h4>
                <p>So much good stuff, girl. We've built Foundation to help you quickly get a site off the ground and to a state where you can easily adapt and modify it into a release. Here's the highlights:</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="six columns">
                        <ul>
                            <li><h5>Global</h5> Foundation's global styles include Eric Meyer's rock-solid reset, tested styles for typography, links, lists, tables and more.</li>
                            <li><h5><a href="<?php echo $this->createUrl("grid"); ?>">The Grid</a></h5> You're gonna like this. Within global.css you'll find The Grid (not the one from Tron), a layout framework that works on mobile devices, small screens and full-on modern desktops. It's a twelve column, semi-liquid, mobile-scaling grid of awesomeness that you're gonna love. It even supports arbitrary nesting.</li>
                            <li><h5><a href="<?php echo $this->createUrl("buttons"); ?>">Buttons</a></h5> We love buttons at ZURB. Foundation includes two base styles, three sizes, and several colors that are preconfigured and super easy to modify.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="six columns">
                        <ul>
                            <li><h5><a href="<?php echo $this->createUrl("forms"); ?>">Forms</a></h5> Hate forms? So do we. They're a pain. Well, we're simplifying that by creating two base styles for forms that are tested, include validation styles, have proper spacing&hellip;all the good stuff. We even included custom radio buttons, checkboxes and select lists so you can style up every form element. They're easy to modify, like everything else.</li>
                            <li><h5><a href="<?php echo $this->createUrl("orbit"); ?>">Orbit</a></h5> That's right - Orbit, the awesome way to put image or content sliders on your page, is packaged in with Foundation. It even works on mobile.</li>
                            <li><h5><a href="<?php echo $this->createUrl("reveal"); ?>">Reveal</a></h5> Finally, we've created a whole new plugin for modal dialogs in Foundation. Reveal is easy to call, supports several intro animations right out of the box, and is completely stylable. It also works on mobile.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
